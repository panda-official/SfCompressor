Sparse Float compressor written by Christian Vorwerk.

## Description

Original code is stored in `original` directory. Because it is not maintainable and can be integrated in our
infrastructure, we refactored it and covered with tests and benchmarks. All updates from Christian are ported manually from
the original code to the refactored code.
